# AstroPIfms
Simple background app for Raspberry Pi to send some sensor data to FileMaker Server through the Data API.

The Raspberry Pi 3 (not 3+) runs Windows 10 IoT and the code is written in Visual Studio 2017 using C#.

If you are not familiar with VS projects or C#, then go straight to this file, where all the magic happens:
